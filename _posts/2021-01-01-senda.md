# SENDA: Navigation System for Spanish F-110 Frigates

The [SENDA navigation system](https://www.gmv.com/en-es/products/defense-and-security/senda) is [GMV’s](/career/experience/) advanced navigation and time reference solution for naval systems. SENDA offers multi-constellation satellite navigation, integrating both military and civilian signals, with robust navigation support even in GNSS-denied environments.

During my time at GMV, I actively contributed to the development of the SENDA system, showcasing my commitment to **quality, collaboration**, and **proactive problem-solving**. My role evolved from maintaining tests and code to leading complex projects, consistently focusing on **best practices** and **effective team communication**.

## First Steps in SENDA: Strengthening Unit Testing

Initially, I was responsible for maintaining and enhancing **Google Tests** for `aerolib`, an internal library managing aeronautical mathematics functions (3D vectors, matrices, quaternions). Instead of merely following instructions, I took a **proactive approach** by improving the **unit testing strategy**. I introduced **automated tests** and random test cases to catch edge scenarios, particularly in floating-point operations, ensuring the robustness and stability of the library.

My contributions went beyond the expected, as I collaborated closely with the **testing team** to refine numerical accuracy thresholds, ensuring that our results met the strict security and reliability standards required by the project.

## Leading the SENDA Recorder Development

After demonstrating solid technical skills, I was given the responsibility of leading the design and development of the **SENDA Recorder** system. This subsystem was essential for capturing raw navigation data from multiple GNSS devices and auxiliary systems (such as IMU, INS), for the **Hespérides (A-33) research vessel**. This task encompassed both hardware and software integration, and I ensured the success of this project through **strong leadership** and **technical proficiency**.

### Hardware Integration and Setup

I oversaw the installation and configuration of devices using communication protocols such as **RS-232**, **RS-422**, and **Ethernet**. I also installed PCI boards, including a **GPIO module** and additional network interfaces, ensuring seamless hardware integration. In addition, I configured the system with an **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)** to maintain high availability, thus protecting against data loss.

Through **effective collaboration** and **diligent validation**, I ensured that the system worked smoothly at the hardware level, validating and verifying every component to ensure it functioned as expected.

### Software Development and Real-Time Recording

On the software side, I developed new device drivers to handle communication with GNSS devices and created a **record-replay module** that could store raw binary messages for later playback. This was essential for testing and ensuring the integrity of recorded data.

To validate the system, I organized and conducted field tests where the SENDA Recorder was mounted in a van. These tests confirmed that the system recorded the data accurately and in the correct format, ensuring that it could perform reliably when deployed on naval vessels.

## Solving Challenges with Reverse Engineering

One of the most complex challenges I faced was integrating a poorly documented device. The limited information available required me to use **reverse engineering techniques** to decode the messages it transmitted. By employing tools such as an **oscilloscope** and through a methodical **trial-and-error** approach, I was able to analyze the device’s communication patterns.

After uncovering discrepancies in the device's message structure, specifically in the **checksum calculations**, I worked closely with the device provider. I documented the issue in detail, including traces and error logs, and presented my findings. My **proactive communication** resulted in the provider acknowledging the bug and issuing a firmware update that resolved the issue. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also demonstrated my ability to **communicate effectively** with external stakeholders and solve problems under pressure.

## Conclusion: Growth Through Proactivity, Leadership, and Quality

My time working on the SENDA project at GMV allowed me to hone my technical skills and grow as a leader. Throughout the project, I emphasized:
- **Proactivity**, by consistently seeking ways to improve processes and enhance the quality of work.
- A commitment to **best practices**, ensuring maintainable, scalable, and high-quality software and hardware integration.
- **Leadership** in guiding both the technical and organizational aspects of the project, from system design to final implementation.
- Strong **collaboration** and **communication skills**, both within the team and with external partners.

This experience solidified my approach to **complex problem-solving** and reinforced the value of combining technical expertise with effective teamwork and communication.
