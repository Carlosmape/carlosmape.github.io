# SIDERA: My Growth and Evolution at SICE

SIDERA is one of the largest SCADA systems I have been part of, and my journey within SICE is a story of growth, commitment, and the pursuit of excellence. 

## State of the Art: The SIDERA Ecosystem

SIDERA is a complex and vast ecosystem that integrates **software** and **hardware** infrastructure, spanning everything from client applications to field devices deployed in tunnels, roads, and railways. At its core, SIDERA is a **supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)** system that plays a critical role in managing and monitoring these systems.

What makes SIDERA particularly challenging is its size and complexity. It's not just about design, development, testing, and deployment â€” the entire product is supported by processes such as **QA**, **CI**, and regular **cybersecurity audits**. Moreover, SIDERA serves a wide array of projects, each with its own unique requirements, from tunnels to highways, making the work both challenging and rewarding.

## My First Steps in SIDERA

When I joined SICE and began working on SIDERA, it was a daunting task. The system was vast, and I had to quickly get up to speed with its components and how they interacted. Initially, my work was focused on simple tasks like **bug fixes**, **feature enhancements**, and integrating new modules.

However, after about three months of familiarizing myself with the system, I gained confidence in my ability to contribute to the overall project. I realized that simply writing code was not enough. I wanted to improve the quality and maintainability of the system.

I adopted **clean code practices** and made a conscious effort to improve every module I worked on. For instance:
- Renaming variables to be more meaningful
- Refactoring methods to ensure they were easily maintainable and testable (unit testing)
- Removing redundant code and ensuring that the system followed best practices for scalability and performance

## Notable Tasks and Use Cases

Over the course of my journey, I participated in various tasks and use cases that helped me expand my skillset. Some of these tasks involved:
- Designing and integrating new modules
- Debugging and fixing issues in existing code
- Optimizing system performance
- Ensuring interoperability with external systems

## Promoted to Tech Lead

After a year of contributing to several international projects, I was promoted to **Tech Lead**, a role I have now held for almost three years. This promotion was not only a recognition of my technical abilities but also a testament to my commitment to the company and the project.

As Tech Lead, my responsibilities expanded significantly, covering both technical and leadership areas:

### Technical Operations
Ensuring the smooth functioning of technical operations, from planning and writing code to reviewing, deploying, and being on call for troubleshooting.

### Team Management
Leading and supervising technical teams, tracking staff progress, assisting with training and recruitment, setting clear goals, and ensuring overall client satisfaction.

### Technical Guidance
Providing guidance to team members on architecture and design decisions, and helping them improve their technical skills.

### Collaboration and Communication
Fostering collaboration among team members and building strong communication channels, both within the team and across other departments.

### Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting complex technical issues that involved software development, engineering tasks, and product releases.

### Leadership
Leading software development teams, demonstrating leadership skills, and ensuring the team was motivated and focused on achieving its objectives.

### Architecture and Design
Taking charge of technical architecture and design decisions, ensuring that these decisions aligned with both business goals and technical requirements.

## The Journey Continues

My journey at SICE has been an incredible learning experience, one that has allowed me to grow not just as a developer but as a leader. I take great pride in my ability to balance technical expertise with effective team management, always striving to promote **innovation**, **best practices**, and **collaboration**.

In my current role, I continue to be involved in the **architecture** and **design** of the SIDERA platform, ensuring it evolves to meet the challenges of the future. With a strong foundation built on dedication, hard work, and a commitment to quality, I look forward to continuing my growth and contributing to the success of SICE and SIDERA.
