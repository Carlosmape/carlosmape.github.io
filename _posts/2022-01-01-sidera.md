# SIDERA
SIDERA is an SCADA which I took part of. If you are interested to know SIDERA, here is an introductory video

## State of the art (Context)
SIDERA has been one of the most largest software product I had taken part of. When I started to work here was very difficult for me to understand the whole system (including the way to work in [SICE](/career/#sice-its-2021now) as company). It is a huge ecosystem of SW and HW infraestructure, manages from, we can say "front-end" or "client" applications, to field devices installed in tunnels, roads, railways etc. 

More over, it count with a robust software engineer procedure: design, development, test, deployment is not the only way. In paralel, there are QA, CI, cibersecurity audits while software engineers are doing their work. But it is also, the product development is driven by so many different projects (of different nature, from tunnels to freeways) with very different requirements each other.

## First steps in SIDERA
I started with little analize, design and development features: some new module to integrate, some wrong baheviour to be debugged and fixed and so on.

After about 3 month I felt comfortable with the system and adquired the confidence to not just develop and fix code. I tried to improve each module I worked wth. I love to do the things with good practices, and in such a huge system like SIDERA it is always a hard labour to make developers maintain this level of quality, specially if the developer has a project deadline, I know that. But I tried to rename variables to try get them naminful, refactored some method to keep them maintenable and easily testable (for unit testing).

## Notable tasks and uses cases
In term of a Sorftware developer, those are some of the tasks I took part of
<div class="posts">
    {% for usecase in site.categories['SICE'] %}
        {% if usecase.title != page.title %}
            {% include post-card.html %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
