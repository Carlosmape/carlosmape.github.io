# State of the art
Some time ago, I tried to root and de-google an old tablet. Just for fun and check by my self the process. Also I want to check if the Gapps consumes more resources (indeed more battery) and I could give more battery life to my device.

I allowed to install custom TWRP recovery system. After that I allowed rooted with Magisk. All this knowledge comes from a huge research in internet. And some try-error. Once rooted, the first thing I done, was to create a system backup using TWRP. All seemed to be nice! Time to play with a rooted tabled and try to "de-google" it!

I started by downloading some app removal for root (I dont know the name, I simply searched in Play Store and tryed some of them). I begin to remove known useless applications i.e.: Vendor pre-installed applications such as one called "Lenovo Tab 4 10" that just shows an usage demo.
