# Course: NodeJS from scratch
## Udemy <span class="date">2022</span>
<div class="skills">
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">NodeJS</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Neo-Vim</div>
</div>
A course that starts from the scratch (reviewing the peculiarities of **JavaScript** such as type-less, object deconstruction...) and deeps in NodeJS advanced concepts (such as managing Node packages with NPM, asynchronous calls and the "Async hell"...)

The Linux Essentials certificate validates a demonstrated understanding of the following Linux related concepts:
 - FOSS, the various communities, and licenses.
 - Knowledge of open source applications in the workplace as they relate to closed source equivalents.
 - Basic concepts of hardware, processes, programs and the components of the Linux Operating System.
 - How to work on the command line and with files.
 - How to create and restore compressed backups and archives.
 - System security, users/groups and file permissions for public and private directories.
 - How to create and run simple scripts.

# Specialization Diploma: Android Apps Development
## Universitat Polit√©cnica de Valencia <span class="date">2018/2019</span>

Adroid development diploma is a reduced course from the original Android Development Master (with almost the same college credits except for the Final Work and enterprise practices ones). I learned to use **Adroid SDK (Java and Kotlin), Android Studio, Firebase** (including it's non-relational DDBB) and basically, how to design, develop and maintain an Android application.

I developed some sample applications but the most remarkable was the one I developed for the diploma's final workr: I worked in an IoT application that integrated an embedded system (an arduino nano with a GPRS module) with an Android app. The application provides users a secure solution to look out their bycicles by installing the IoT device in the bike's chasis and connecting to their phones. You can read this project in further detail in [Cylock](/projects/cylock) section.

In a brief I started the Degree excited about Systems, not in development. In the Degree's program, includes 2 last years of specialization, in my case I chose "Computer engineering" branch, more focused in low-level programming including some Software Engineering topics but focused to embedded systems development, HW Architecture and networkings. In these last 2 years it begin to started to increase my interest in programming quite a bit focused in low-level and real-time software development.

At the University I specially felt confortable with networkings and system administration, however, I learned a lot of algorithm, data structure and programming paradigms. Such as a bunch of known algorithms like optimization ones, A\*, DFS, BFS, sorting ones such as bubble-short...

Some of the most used languages during the studies were **C/C++, Bash-scripting, Ruby, VHDL, Lisp**
