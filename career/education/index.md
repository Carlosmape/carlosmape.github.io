    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Data Warehousing</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">ETL Processes</div>
</div>
I gained practical knowledge in **data-driven decision-making processes**. The course covered key areas such as **BI project management**, including planning, resource coordination, and **data quality assurance**. I also learned about **BI architecture**, focusing on designing systems that integrate data sources, **data warehouses**, and **ETL processes** to deliver actionable insights through **reporting and analysis tools**. This experience equipped me with the skills to contribute to the successful implementation of **BI solutions** in business environments.

# Course: NodeJS from scratch  
## Udemy <span class="date">2022</span>
<div class="skills">
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">NodeJS</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">JavaScript</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">NPM</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Neo-Vim</div>
</div>
In this course, I started from the basics, reviewing **JavaScript**'s unique characteristics such as **type-less operations** and **object deconstruction**. The course then delved into advanced **NodeJS** concepts, including managing Node packages with **NPM**, handling **asynchronous calls**, and avoiding the so-called "Async hell."

# Certification: LPI Essentials

    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">System Security</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Command Line</div>
</div>
The **Linux Essentials** certification validated my understanding of key **Linux-related concepts**:
- **FOSS**, open-source communities, and licensing.
- **Open source applications** in the workplace compared to closed-source equivalents.
- Basic **hardware**, processes, and the structure of the **Linux Operating System**.
- Mastery of the **command line** and file management.
- Creation and management of **compressed backups** and archives.
- **System security**, managing **users/groups**, and handling **file permissions**.
- How to create and run **simple shell scripts**.

# Specialization Diploma: Android Apps Development  
## Universitat Politècnica de València <span class="date">2018/2019</span>
<div class="skills">
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Android</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Firebase</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Java</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Kotlin</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Android Studio</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">IoT</div>
</div>
The **Android Development** diploma was a condensed version of the full master's program, focusing on the same core content. I mastered the **Android SDK** using **Java** and **Kotlin**, and tools like **Android Studio** and **Firebase** (including its **non-relational database** features). The course taught me how to **design, develop, and maintain** Android applications.

For my diploma’s final project, I developed an IoT application that integrated an embedded system (an **Arduino Nano** with a GPRS module) with an Android app. The app allowed users to monitor their bicycles securely by installing the IoT device on the bike's chassis and connecting it to their phones. You can read more about this project in the [Cylock](/projects/cylock) section.

# Bachelor's Degree: Computer Engineering  
## Universidad de La Laguna <span class="date">2011/2016</span>
<div class="skills">
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Linux</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Shell Scripting</div>

    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Algorithms</div>
    <div class="skill-card backgrounded">Networks</div>
</div>
I started my degree with an interest in **systems** rather than software development. However, as I advanced through the program—particularly during the final two years, where I specialized in **Computer Engineering**—I gained deep knowledge in **low-level programming** and **real-time software development**, with a focus on **embedded systems**, **hardware architecture**, and **networking**.

While I found system administration and networks pa
