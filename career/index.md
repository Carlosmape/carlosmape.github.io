# Work Experience

## Rieka Talent (ITS):
### C++ Software engineer
I work here for an end client [SICE](https://www.sice.com/) as a Software Engineer. About what I was expecting for this role, was mainly to change the defense sector, however I was looking for keep in the sames technologies and practices I did in my last work: critical/real-time systems and low level programming.

My labour in SICE is to maintain an SCADA (called [SIDERA](https://www.sice.com/en/video/sidera-general-overview)) in the firsts spteps of the software engineer life-cycle: To analyze project's requirement, design features, develop and maintaining the code and finally, deploying and configuring in to prodcution environment. I participate in multiple SIDERA's modules such as OCS (a recursive DFS algirthm to calculate energization status of railway catenary sections), SIDERA integration with external data providers/consumers etc.

Adittionally I am helping to coordinate a project. Leading with costumer meetings, coorginating back-end developments and doing documentation tasks such as System Architecture designing, tasks supervisions, Test Cases desiging and supervising compliance of the project's requirements. 

You can see related [remarkable projects](/projects/sidera) section to read in deep about my thoughts about the projects I participated in this company.

##  GMV (ITS, defense):
### C++ Software engineer
This was my second work experience. When I applied to [GMV](https://www.gmv.com/), I was looking for a larger company to previous one, to try join in a bigger software team where I could learn some software engineering practices, such as development methodologies, participate in code revisions, meetings and so on.

In my first project, I worked for Madrid's Metro (written in C#, .NET Framework) developing an electrical/mechanical subway simulator, I applied kinematics and electrical calculations, minimum train frequency in a line etc. You can read [Metro Simulator](/projects/metro) section to read in deep about my thoughts about this project.

My second project in the company was [SENDA](https://www.gmv.com/en-es/products/defense-and-security/senda), a positioning system for a spanish army new ship. Without going into much detail, I firstrly participated in the Testing Team (Google Test, PyTest), once created first tests suite version, the project's manager, lead me to took care of an entire recording system, to record different positioning device's raw data in order to generate a testing bench for my aeronautical team mates, who were developing the advanced positioning algorithms. I worked in a fork of the original code (C++), within crytical/real time system practices, I integrated INS, GPS, Galileo PRS and other devices, with low level decoding of these device's messages.


##  InfoGestión (business management software):
### C++ Software Engineer
This was my very first work experience. Just recently finished my Informatics Degree, I was lookng for a little company, to learn the basics of a business and where I could develop some applications that could be used by someone. Then I joined to [nfogestión SLU](https://www.infogestionslu.com/)

In this company I worked as Full Stack Software Engineer learning all the software product lyfe-cycle. As a [SAGE's](https://www.sage.com/) partner I mainly development of some SAGE 50 plugins (C# .NET Framework and SQL Server DDBB) adjusting to the needs of our costumers. 

Secondly I designed and implemented another .NET desktop applications related to that ERP where I could practice with multithreading, window services and SQL queries optimizations.In both tasks I learned to lead with costumers trying to traduce their petitions to software requirements. 

In the background I helped to maintain an own product, a CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management Sofware) called [Nadilux](https://www.nadilux.com/) written in ASP/NET. I could work with customer information terminals and bluetooth printers.
