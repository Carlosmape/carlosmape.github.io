# Technical skills
This page showcases my hard skills, punctuated based on the projects Iâ€™ve worked on. The content displayed reflects my expertise in various technologies, operating systems, databases, languages, and IDEs. The progress bars are computed using the data collected from the **[projects](/projects)** section, giving a visual representation of my proficiency in each skill category.

{% for d in site.data %}
{% assign group = d[0]%}
{% assign skills = d[1]%}
{% assign val = site.posts | where_exp: "post", "post[group] != nil" | size %}

## {{ group | capitalize }}
{% for skill in skills %}
{% assign punct = site.posts | where: group, skill | size %}
{% assign punct = val | divided_by: punct | times: 10 %}
{% assign punct = 100 | minus: punct %}
{% include skill-bar.html %}
{% endfor %}
