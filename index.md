# Hi, I'm Carlos Martín
**I'm a Computer - Software Engineer**.
I love either to develop software (focused on low-level, performance and efficiency) and all related with computing (integrating hardware devices, architectural silutions and OS management & configurations)

This site is something like my head quarters. I will try to let me know. I will regularly add interesting things I learned (in [Thoughts section](/posts/)). For further information, feel free to discover it here.

## My career
In [Career](/career) section you can find extense information about my work and academic career in detail. You can also [download my resume in standard format](/assets/docs/Carlosmape-cv.pdf).
