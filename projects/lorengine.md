# Introduction
Some time ago, I decided to try some high level programming lenguages. At the university I learned Ruby and some time ago I enroled in a NodeJS course, that was fine both. But I was lookin to learn more and more. Some colleages used Python and talked to me about it great advantage to process huge bunches of data (they're data-scientist, it is logical to be using Python tho). So my curiosity was increasing nad I thought: why not? Let's start a project using Python and learn-practicing in my free time, but... what kind of project should I start?

I always loved video games and felt curious about how to do a great one. At the university, one of the project I participated was a classic [rogue-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game (C++) for CLI. It could be a good idea to do something similar. But why start a project that I already did? So I tried to think about this base and give a added value. Relating this idea to the Python powerfull built-in methods to manage data, I decided to take advantage of it. So First (good) idea I had was to create a Dialog system for games, but not in the simple way, I wanted to add some fancier functionalitys such as a sympathy system such as in the real life and another features I thinked it could be nice to implement it that will be explained in detail later. 

## First steps
First of all, as I (almost) always do: an research of the technology that I am going to use. I started by simple viewing some other little Python projects to familiarize myself with the syntax of the language, see how elementary and basic operations are done and finally some more related o the project itself the architecture and projects organization (called modules for Python)

So I started by there, creating a module and a executable script that uses the module and wich I could test the developments.

# Thoughts
LoreEngine, my own video game Engine. In fact not a graphics/physics engine. A game lore generator, that manages procedural map generation, conversational system, character's relationships and sympathy system, factions, diplomacy, stories... Definitely the game environment-history itself
